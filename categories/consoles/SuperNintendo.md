## SNES in-flight Airplane hardware (Nintendo Gateway)
In 1993 Nintendo introduced an in-flight entertainment system called the Gateway, this system allowed passengers to play SNES games for about 4 USD an hour.

The Journalist **Ernie Smith** has written an excellent article on his site which you can access at [Will the In-Flight Entertainment System Survive COVID-19?](https://tedium.co/2020/06/19/in-flight-entertainment-system-covid-19-impact-history/) and also tweeted out the Nintendo Power article which talks about it: 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember when you could play Super NES games on a plane? That was awesome. Nintendo Power, circa Feb. &#39;94: <a href="https://t.co/iKm6mLB8Us">pic.twitter.com/iKm6mLB8Us</a></p>&mdash; Ernie Smith (@ShortFormErnie) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShortFormErnie/status/834989238810775552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Also if you prefer video-based content the youtuber **Top Hat Gaming Man** has created an excellent video on the subject:

Excellent video by **Displaced Gamers** on how to edit SRAM saves for a Link to the Past on Super Nintendo, this is not actually **ROM Hacking** as the ROM is exactly the same, it is only the SRAM that is modified.
