Ghidra is the most advanced reverse engineering tool on the market, and best of all it is completly free and open source! Most of the content on RetroReversing will be using Ghidra going forward due to it being much more accessable than competitors such as IDA Pro.

# Introduction to Ghidra
There is no better way to start out the hobby reverse engineering than learning Ghidra, it is an essentail tool that takes much of the headaches out of reversing.

# Nintendo 64
Nintendo 64 games can be slightly harder to reverse due to everything being bundles as one large ROM image containing all the code and assets used in the game. Luckily there are a few tools that can help, such as the `Reversing Emulator` and a N64 Loader for Ghidra.
