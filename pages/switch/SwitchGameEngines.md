When reverse engineering games, one of the first things to find out is which engine the game is based on, this will save a considerable amount of time if it is based on a standard engine that is well documented.

This page will list only the confirmed engines for each game along with proof that the game3 was built with that engine, so the list won't contain every game, but any game on the list you can be confident it was based on the engine listed.

# Unity3d
<section class="postSection">
    <img src="/public/images/engines/UnrealEngineLogo.png" style="width:inherit;" class="wow slideInLeft postImage" />
<div markdown="1">
Unity3d has supported the Nintendo Switch right from launch and the dev tools are distributed by Nintendo themselves rather than by Unity. Developers need to have signed up for a Nintendo Developer account to be granted access to download the Unity plugin to allow exporting to Switch [^1].

## Reverse Engineering & Modding
Unity3D games are compiled from .net byte code down to C++ when generating a Nintendo Switch version. This makes it harder than standard Unity reverse engineering as the generated native code is harder to decompile than .net byte code.

There are tools than support dumping the data from Unity NRO games such as the Il2CppDumper:
[https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper)

You should always backup **Managed/Metadata/global-metadata.dat** as it contains debug symbols for the game.

## Games built with Unity
The best way to check if a switch game is using the Unity engine is to look in the RomFs filesystem for a file called `Managed/Metadata/global-metadata.dat`, this contains debug symbols, the larger the file size the more symbols are included.

# Unreal Engine 4
<section class="postSection">
<img src="/public/images/engines/UnrealEngineLogo.png" style="width:inherit;" class="wow slideInLeft postImage" />
<div markdown="1">
The Unreal Engine was developed by [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/) initially for their game `Unreal` but later evolved to become a product in itself with many 3rd party games studios taking advantage of its power.
</div>

## Games
You can detect Unreal Engine games on the Nintendo switch very easily by looking at the root of the ROMFS section and if it contains a file called **UE4CommandLine.txt** then it is likely to be an UnrealEngine 4 game.

Game Name | Proof of engine
---|---
9 Monkeys of Shaolin | UE4CommandLine.txt
Bioshock remastered | `engine.u`
Gigantosaurus The Game | UE4CommandLine.txt
GRIP Combat racing | UE4CommandLine.txt
