# NES Sprite Tile editing with Tile Layer Pro

If you have ever wondered how graphical rom hacks are made this is for you! This should work for most early games such as NES and Gameboy. Future generation games start to compress their sprites which makes it more difficult.

Back in the day of NES and Gameboy development, the sprites and tiles were saved in the rom file completely uncompressed and thus visible with the correct editor.

You need to download an application called 'Tile Layer Pro'.

One cool feature of Tile Layer Pro is being able to open multiple games at once and copy tiles over. In the video below they copy a ghost from pacman and replace the mario goomba with it!
