From the GDC Youtube Channel:

> Not many people are designing video games for MS-DOS these days, but that didn't stop Vblank Entertainment's Brian Provinciano from taking on the task. 
>
> In this 2016 talk, hear Provinciano explain how he reduced memory usage down to 4MB, increased performance to run on a 486 PC, reduced disk space to fit on a single 1.44MB floppy, and finally ported the game to MS-DOS itself.
>
> GDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. 
>
> We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.  Subscribe to the channel to stay on top of regular updates, and check out GDC Vault  for thousands of more in-depth talks from our archives [^1].
