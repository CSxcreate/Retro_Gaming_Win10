On the 25th of July 2020, the day after the `Gigaleak`, its sequel Gigaleak 2 was uploaded to a thread on 4chan. This is a continuation of the leaks that were obtained from a iQue/BroadOn/Routefree hack earlier in the year. 

---
# Uploaded Files
This leak contained files for a Version Control Repository (CVS) owned by the creators of the Chinese iQue Player (Routefree). It mainly focussed on Nintendo 64 source code but also contained a few Gameboy Advance (AGB) files too. Note that this was sent from Nintendo to iQue for the purpose of creating a Chinese localised version of the main N64 games such as:
* 1080 snowboarding
* Animal Crossing/Forest
* Dr Mario 64
* F-Zero X
* Super Mario 64
* Mario Kart 64
* Wave Race 64
* Zelda (MM & OOT).

Files Leaked:
* bbgames.7z (just contains bbgames.tar)

## Step 1 - Extracting the tar
The first step after extracting the 7Zip file to to extract the tar archive, you can do this like so:
```bash
tarÂ -xvf bbgames.tar
```
If you get an error such as "Cannot open: Invalid argument" it is due to some of the file names containing characters that are invalid on a FAT* based File System. So you will need to extract on a different file system such as NTSC [^1].

## Step 2 - Installing CVS and checking out files
You will need to first have the CVS command line utilities installed if you haven't already then you can install like so:
* Mac OSX: `brew install cvs`
* Ubuntu Linux: `apt-get install cvs`

Now run the command in a folder that you want to extract the files:
```bash
cvs -d path/to/download/d1/routefree/bbgames/depot checkout .
```

It is a very large repository so expect it to take a while to complete.

---
# Root directory (d1/routefree/bbgames/depot)
This section will give you an overview of all the main folder contained at the root directory of the extracted leak.

# 1080 Snowboarding (1080 folder)
The 1080 folder contains two main subfolders **apps** and **lib**, the **apps** folder is where the main source code and assets are contained and the **lib** folder just contains a single static library known as `libgdl_u64.a`

## GDL Static Library (libgdl_u64.a)
It is not clear what the purpose of the GDL static library is yet or if it was used in any other games, but we do know it was created by **Giles Goddard** due to this line in the Makefile:
```
/usr/people/giles/src/stl/latest
```

There is also reference to a tool called **GDEDIT** in the same Makefile so it could be linked to this library or it could be that Giles just prefixed **GD** to the start of any tool he created.

There doesn't seem to be any source code in the leaks for this library but since a static library is just an archive, we can list the contents with the following command:
```
ar t libgdl_u64.a
```

The files contained in the library will be listed in the table below along with any descriptions that help identify the purpose of the objects:

## Main Source Code (apps/ski folder)
The main source code is neatly organised into a bunch of sub folders, this makes it one of the tidiest source code folders in the leak.

<div class="rr-changelog-category">
  <div class="rr-version-gen" version="Ski" date="Main Source Code folder" ></div>
    <ul class="rr-changelog-more">
      <div class="rr-info-gen" badge="data" desc="Contains Asset data such as Player animations, maps and effects" ></div>
      <div class="rr-info-gen" badge="flow" desc="Game Flow code - seems to be the main game code" ></div>
<div class="rr-info-gen" badge="gui" desc="The main game GUI" ></div>
<div class="rr-info-gen" badge="snow" desc="Code for snow effects, including board spray and trail" ></div>
<div class="rr-info-gen" badge="u64" desc="Contains the standard build toolchain such as makefiles, boot code and rom specs" ></div>
<div class="rr-info-gen" badge="world" desc="World Editor pre-compiled code" ></div>
    </ul>
</div>

Unfortunately there is no uncompiled source code for 1080 snowboarding, so don't expect any *.c or *.h files here, but the precompiled ELF objects *.o can be very interesting indeed.

If anyone is interested in a full rundown of what each of the pre-compiled objects contains and how they are related to the final ROM then let us know and we can create a new page for this purpose.

# Dr Mario 64 (dm64 folder)
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The full complete source code to Dr Mario 64 has been successfully compiled! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/n64?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#n64</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nintendoleak?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#nintendoleak</a> <a href="https://t.co/y66ryCOmgJ">https://t.co/y66ryCOmgJ</a></p>&mdash; RetroReversing.com (@RetroReversing) <a href="https://twitter.com/RetroReversing/status/1287691481772326919?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 27, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

# F-Zero X (f0x folder)
The source code for F-Zero X is nowhere near as well organised as the 1080 Snowboarding code, BUT it actually has source code and not just pre-compiled object files!

Also this is not just the code to the N64 version but also contains the 64DD course editor!

<div class="rr-changelog-category">

    <ul class="rr-changelog-more">

 <div class="rr-info-gen" badge="sound" desc="Audio data" ></div>
    </ul>
</div>

The source files seem to be named after the developer that was responsible for them, this was common practise in the early days of software development before good quality source control.

The table below covers the most common prefixes found in the F-Zero source code.

## Textures (IMAGES folder)

There are some interesting images in the F-Zero X source code, including an image of Beavis from Beavis and Butthead.

# Animal Crossing (forest folder)
Animal Forest (Animal Crossing in the west) source code was initially based on the Zelda source code and thus has a few similar files to the OOT source also present in the leak.

## CLI Tools (zelda_tool_copy folder)
The **zelda_tool_copy** founds far more interesting than it actually is, it is really just a subset of command line tools provided in the N64 and iQue sdks and none of them are zelda specific, these tools were used to create most games.

Note that if you are interest in the source code for any of these tools then you can find it in "BroadOn Leak".

{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/broadon-archive" description="For more information about the BroadOn N64 Leak." %}

Name | Description
---|---
romalign | Align a ROM file to a certain boundary
romfill  |  Source code for this tool in BroadOn leak
romaddress |  Possibly new version of the romaddress perl script from the N64 OS SDK
romdivide |   ?
rommap | Prints out a map of the ROM, similar to  the rommap perl script from the N64 OS SDK
rommap_new  |Modified version of rommap
slidec | SLI decompressor decompresses a szp or szs file (Version 1.0)
slicnv |  SLI converter, converts szpfile to szsfile (Version 1.0)
sliencV11 | SLI compressor (Version 1.1)
 
What is interesting about the tools above is that it uses the SZS extension for compression, so Nintendo have been using this format from at least the N64 until present day Switch titles!
