# Introduction
Nintendo introduced the `Nintendo Web Framework` or NWF in the 2013 Game Developers Conference. You can view the announcement on the GDC Vault: [GDC Vault - Nintendo Wii U Application Development with HTML and JavaScript](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1018072/Nintendo-Wii-U-Application-Development)

What better way to describe the new WiiU HTML5 development environment than the official Nintendo Website [^2]:
```
The Nintendo Web Framework is a development environment that makes building Wii U applications simple. Founded on WebKit technologies and harnessing common programs - including HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS - it allows development to span across the Wii U GamePad, Wii Remote controllers, and more.
```

# Implementation
The NWF is based on webkit with a bunch of libraries that allow javascript to get input from the WiiU gamepads [^1].

# Mario vs Donkey Tipping Stars in NWF
An official Nintendo game built using HTML5?!! Yup..
GDC 2013 demo of Mario vs Donkey Kong built using the Nintendo Web Framework: [(212) Mario vs. Donkey Kong Wii U - GDC Web Framework Demo - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFwU1T4id1c)

The game is completely written in Javascript and the source code seems to be available if you extract the wiiU app files!
