It is very rare that a commercial game releases its source code to the public, it is even rarer for that to be a console game, but there have been a few exciting cases in recent history which we will explore in this post.

To be considered for this list the game must have at least a quarter of the source code used to make the game/prototype released.

This list does not contain fan decompilations of retail games, for those we have a separate page:

# Nintendo Systems
Nintendo systems have by far the largest selection of official source code to choose from, some of it has been leaked and others have been released officially by the developers.

## GameBoy (DMG & GBC)

### Days of Thunder

This section has all the consoles Microsoft made which are considered retro enough to include here. We currently do not list anything after the original Xbox but this may change in the future when the 360 can safely be classified as a retro system.

## Original Xbox
The original Xbox was a joy to program for, especially for PC developers who were familiar with the Direct X API. However very few xbox games have ever has their source code leaked.
